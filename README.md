Command description:
usage: recog.py [-h] -f FILENAME [-o OUTPUT_DIR]

To run and example, simply type:

python recog.py -i input/friends.jpg

Please note that you will need opecv, tensorflow and keras installed. This can be tricky for some distribution. 
I suggest to install Anaconda, create a virtualenv and install the required packages from there. It was easier in this way.
