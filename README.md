# face_detect

Command description:
usage: detect.py [-h] -f FILENAME [-o OUTPUT_DIR]

To run an example, type:

python detect.py -i input/friends.jpg

Please, note that you will need Opencv, Tensorflow and Keras installed. This can be tricky for some distributions and operating systems, such as Windows. I suggest to install Anaconda, create a virtualenv and install the required packages from there. It was easier in this way.
